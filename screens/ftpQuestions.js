Q: about us
A: Plateful is a digital bridge between farmers and communities.

Born out of the need to empower small-scale farmers and bring fresh, locally grown produce directly to consumers, Plateful is more than just a marketplace—it's a movement.

We recognize the struggles of our local growers: limited access to markets, low profits due to middlemen, and the challenge of using modern tools. At the same time, consumers are seeking fresher, healthier, and more sustainable food options. Plateful responds to both.

Through innovative technology and a user-friendly mobile platform, Plateful simplifies how farmers sell and how consumers shop. With features like real-time order tracking, secure payments, and direct messaging, we eliminate unnecessary steps and focus on what matters—quality food and fair trade.

Plateful is proudly developed by passionate minds from the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines, driven to uplift the local agricultural sector and encourage community-driven sustainability.

By choosing Plateful, you support:
• Fair income for farmers
• Access to fresher produce
• A shorter, greener supply chain
• Stronger local food systems

Together, we’re reimagining farm-to-plate, one harvest at a time.
